Today I'm releasing Cap'n Proto 0.9.

There's no huge new features in this release, but there are many minor improvements and bug fixes. You can [read the PR history](https://github.com/capnproto/capnproto/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed) to find out what has changed.

Cap'n Proto development has continued to be primarily driven by the [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/) project (of which I'm the lead engineer). As of the previous release, Cloudflare Workers primarily used the [KJ C++ toolkit](https://github.com/capnproto/capnproto/blob/master/kjdoc/tour.md) that is developed with Cap'n Proto, but made only light use of Cap'n Proto serialization and RPC itself. That has now changed: the implementation of [Durable Objects](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-workers-durable-objects/) makes heavy use of Cap'n Proto RPC for essentially all communication within the system.
