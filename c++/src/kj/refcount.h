  //
  // Do NOT use this lightly.  Refcounting is a crutch.  Good designs should strive to make object
  // ownership clear, so that refcounting is not necessary.  All that said, reference counting can
  // sometimes simplify code that would otherwise become convoluted with explicit ownership, even
  // when ownership relationships are clear at an abstract level.
  //
  // NOT THREADSAFE:  This refcounting implementation assumes that an object's references are
  // manipulated only in one thread, because atomic (thread-safe) refcounting is surprisingly slow.
  //
  // In general, abstract classes should _not_ subclass this.  The concrete class at the bottom
  // of the hierarchy should be the one to decide how it implements refcounting.  Interfaces should
  // expose only an `addRef()` method that returns `Own<InterfaceType>`.  There are two reasons for
  // this rule:
  // 1. Interfaces would need to virtually inherit Refcounted, otherwise two refcounted interfaces
  //    could not be inherited by the same subclass.  Virtual inheritance is awkward and
  //    inefficient.
  // 2. An implementation may decide that it would rather return a copy than a refcount, or use
  //    some other strategy.
  //
  // TODO(cleanup):  Rethink above.  Virtual inheritance is not necessarily that bad.  OTOH, a
  //   virtual function call for every refcount is sad in its own way.  A Ref<T> type to replace
  //   Own<T> could also be nice.
