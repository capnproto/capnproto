class UnixEventPort: public EventPort, private TimerImpl::SleepHooks {
  // An EventPort implementation which can wait for events on file descriptors as well as signals.
  // This API only makes sense on Unix.
  //
  // The implementation uses `poll()` or possibly a platform-specific API (e.g. epoll, kqueue).
  // To also wait on signals without race conditions, the implementation may block signals until
  // just before `poll()` while using a signal handler which `siglongjmp()`s back to just before
  // the signal was unblocked, or it may use a nicer platform-specific API.
  //
  // The implementation reserves a signal for internal use.  By default, it uses SIGUSR1.  If you
  // need to use SIGUSR1 for something else, you must offer a different signal by calling
  // setReservedSignal() at startup. (On Linux, no signal is reserved; eventfd is used instead.)
  //
  // WARNING: A UnixEventPort can only be used in the thread and process that created it. In
  //   particular, note that after a fork(), a UnixEventPort created in the parent process will
  //   not work correctly in the child, even if the parent ceases to use its copy. In particular
  //   note that this means that server processes which daemonize themselves at startup must wait
  //   until after daemonization to create a UnixEventPort.
  //
  // TODO(cleanup): The above warning is no longer accurate -- daemonizing after creating a
  //   UnixEventPort should now work since we no longer use signalfd. But do we want to commit to
  //   keeping it that way? Note it's still unsafe to fork() and then use UnixEventPort from both
  //   processes!

  Promise<siginfo_t> onSignal(int signum);
  // When the given signal is delivered to this thread, return the corresponding siginfo_t.
  // The signal must have been captured using `captureSignal()`.
  //
  // If `onSignal()` has not been called, the signal will remain blocked in this thread.
  // Therefore, a signal which arrives before `onSignal()` was called will not be "missed" -- the
  // next call to 'onSignal()' will receive it.  Also, you can control which thread receives a
  // process-wide signal by only calling `onSignal()` on that thread's event loop.
  //
  // The result of waiting on the same signal twice at once is undefined.
  //
  // WARNING: On MacOS and iOS, `onSignal()` will only see process-level signals, NOT
  //   thread-specific signals (i.e. not those sent with pthread_kill()). This is a limitation of
  //   Apple's implemnetation of kqueue() introduced in MacOS 10.14 which Apple says is not a bug.
  //   See: https://github.com/libevent/libevent/issues/765 Consider using kj::Executor or
  //   kj::newPromiseAndCrossThreadFulfiller() for cross-thread communications instead of signals.
  //   If you must have signals, build KJ and your app with `-DKJ_USE_KQUEUE=0`, which will cause
  //   KJ to fall back to a generic poll()-based implementation that is less efficient but handles
  //   thread-specific signals.

  static void captureSignal(int signum);
  // Arranges for the given signal to be captured and handled via UnixEventPort, so that you may
  // then pass it to `onSignal()`.  This method is static because it registers a signal handler
  // which applies process-wide.  If any other threads exist in the process when `captureSignal()`
  // is called, you *must* set the signal mask in those threads to block this signal, otherwise
  // terrible things will happen if the signal happens to be delivered to those threads.  If at
  // all possible, call `captureSignal()` *before* creating threads, so that threads you create in
  // the future will inherit the proper signal mask.
  //
  // To un-capture a signal, simply install a different signal handler and then un-block it from
  // the signal mask.

  // Sets the signal number which `UnixEventPort` reserves for internal use.  If your application

  Promise<int> onChildExit(Maybe<pid_t>& pid);
  // When the given child process exits, resolves to its wait status, as returned by wait(2). You
  // will need to use the WIFEXITED() etc. macros to interpret the status code.
  //
  // You must call onChildExit() immediately after the child is created, before returning to the
  // event loop. Otherwise, you may miss the child exit event.
  //
  // `pid` is a reference to a Maybe<pid_t> which must be non-null at the time of the call. When
  // wait() is invoked (and indicates this pid has finished), `pid` will be nulled out. This is
  // necessary to avoid a race condition: as soon as the child has been wait()ed, the PID table
  // entry is freed and can then be reused. So, if you ever want safely to call `kill()` on the
  // PID, it's necessary to know whether it has been wait()ed already. Since the promise's
  // .then() continuation may not run immediately, we need a more precise way, hence we null out
  // the Maybe.
  //
  // The caller must NOT null out `pid` on its own unless it cancels the Promise first. If the
  // caller decides to cancel the Promise, and `pid` is still non-null after this cancellation,
  // then the caller is expected to `waitpid()` on it BEFORE returning to the event loop again.
  // Probably, the caller should kill() the child before waiting to avoid a hang. If the caller
  // fails to do its own waitpid() before returning to the event loop, the child may become a
  // zombie, or may be reaped automatically, depending on the platform -- since the caller does not
  // know, the caller cannot try to reap the zombie later.
  //
  // You must call `kj::UnixEventPort::captureChildExit()` early in your program if you want to use
  // `onChildExit()`.
  //
  // WARNING: Only one UnixEventPort per process is allowed to use onChildExit(). This is because
  //   child exit is signaled to the process via SIGCHLD, and Unix does not allow the program to
  //   control which thread receives the signal. (We may fix this in the future by automatically
  //   coordinating between threads when multiple threads are expecting child exits.)
  // WARNING 2: If any UnixEventPort in the process is currently waiting for onChildExit(), then
  //   *only* that port's thread can safely wait on child processes, even synchronously. This is
  //   because the thread which used onChildExit() uses wait() to reap children, without specifying
  //   which child, and therefore it may inadvertently reap children created by other threads.

  static void captureChildExit();
  // Arranges for child process exit to be captured and handled via UnixEventPort, so that you may
  // call `onChildExit()`. Much like `captureSignal()`, this static method must be called early on
  // in program startup.
  //
  // This method may capture the `SIGCHLD` signal. You must not use `captureSignal(SIGCHLD)` nor
  // `onSignal(SIGCHLD)` in your own code if you use `captureChildExit()`.

  int getPollableFd();
  // Get a file descriptor which represents the EventPort's backing OS event queue, and becomes
  // readable when there are events to process. This may be an epoll FD or a kqueue FD depending on
  // the OS.
  //
  // You MUST use preparePollableFdForSleep() before waiting on this FD.
  //
  // The caller should not perform operations on this FD. It should only be used for polling in
  // some other event loop. This can be useful for allowing UnixEventPort to operate embedded in
  // an application that uses some other event loop as its main loop. Whenever this FD becomes
  // readable, call waitScope.poll() to handle all available events, then
  // `preparePollableFdForSleep()`.
  //
  // It's also possible to use this to drive multiple event loops from the same thread, or even
  // multiple threads in an m:n mapping. When an event loop becomes ready, create a temporary
  // WaitScope on the thread where you want to run it, pump the loop, and then destroy the
  // WaitScope. A WaitScope binds a loop to a thread while it exists, but an event loop is allowed
  // to change threads and a thread is allowed to change event loops as long as no WaitScope is
  // currently binding them.
  //
  // TODO(someday): Currently this is only implemented for epoll, NOT for kqueue. But in principle
  //   it should be possible to implement for kqueue as well.

  void preparePollableFdForSleep();
  // If you plan to monitor the FD return by getPollableFd() for notifications that this queue is ready,
  // you must call preparePollableFdForSleep() after each run of this port's event loop in order to
  // ensure that all event types will in fact wake up the queue.
  //
  // This call is needed in particular to arrange for timer events. Normally, timer events are not
  // implemented via the epoll/kqueue at all, but instead the call to epoll_wait() / kevent() is
  // given a timeout that causes it to return early when the next timer event is scheduled. This
  // doesn't work when the wait is being performed on an external event loop, so instead the
  // implementation must arrange to use timerfd (for epoll) of EVFILT_TIMER (for kqueue) so that
  // the queue FD actually becomes ready when the next timer event is ready to run. This requires
  // some extra syscalls, unfortunately.
  //
  // A second reason this call is needed is to wake up the event queue if any work is queued
  // directly to the event loop via function calls rather than OS events. For example, if anyone
  // calls `fulfill()` on a `PromiseFulfiller`, thus queuing work to this event loop, it needs
  // to wake up. The EventPort achieves this by implicitly calling `wake()` if any work is queued
  // while sleeping -- similar to a cross-thread wakeup. NOTE: Queuing work like this while the
  // event loop is asleep is only safe if the EventLoop is still bound to the thread by the
  // existence of a WaitScope. If you are destroying the WaitScope while sleeping, then you cannot
  // manipulate promises attached to this loop at all while it is asleep. (Cross-thread events,
  // e.g. queued via newPromiseAndCrossThreadFulfiller(), or via kj::Executor, are always safe.
  // These will cause the queue fd to become ready so that the loop can wake up and respond to the
  // events.)
  //
  // This method will throw an exception if the port is currently waiting on any signals via
  // onSignal() or onChildExit(). Although it might theoretically be possible to support signals in
  // this mode, deep flaws in the relevant APIs across multiple OSs make it likely not worth
  // attempting.
