class UnixEventPort: public EventPort {
  // An EventPort implementation which can wait for events on file descriptors as well as signals.
  // This API only makes sense on Unix.
  //
  // The implementation uses `poll()` or possibly a platform-specific API (e.g. epoll, kqueue).
  // To also wait on signals without race conditions, the implementation may block signals until
  // just before `poll()` while using a signal handler which `siglongjmp()`s back to just before
  // the signal was unblocked, or it may use a nicer platform-specific API like signalfd.
  //
  // The implementation reserves a signal for internal use.  By default, it uses SIGUSR1.  If you
  // need to use SIGUSR1 for something else, you must offer a different signal by calling
  // setReservedSignal() at startup.
  //
  // WARNING: A UnixEventPort can only be used in the thread and process that created it. In
  //   particular, note that after a fork(), a UnixEventPort created in the parent process will
  //   not work correctly in the child, even if the parent ceases to use its copy. In particular
  //   note that this means that server processes which daemonize themselves at startup must wait
  //   until after daemonization to create a UnixEventPort.

  // If `onSignal()` has not been called, the signal will remain blocked in this thread.
  // Therefore, a signal which arrives before `onSignal()` was called will not be "missed" -- the
  // next call to 'onSignal()' will receive it.  Also, you can control which thread receives a
  // process-wide signal by only calling `onSignal()` on that thread's event loop.

  // which applies process-wide.  If any other threads exist in the process when `captureSignal()`
  // is called, you *must* set the signal mask in those threads to block this signal, otherwise
  // terrible things will happen if the signal happens to be delivered to those threads.  If at
  // all possible, call `captureSignal()` *before* creating threads, so that threads you create in
  // the future will inherit the proper signal mask.

  // To un-capture a signal, simply install a different signal handler and then un-block it from

  // The presence of out-of-band data should NOT fire this event. However, the event may

  // cause such spurrious events is the arrival of OOB data on certain platforms whose event
  // interfaces fail to distinguish between regular and OOB data (e.g. Mac OSX).
  //
  // WARNING: The exact behavior of this class differs across systems, since event interfaces
  //   vary wildly. Be sure to read the documentation carefully and avoid depending on unspecified
  //   behavior. If at all possible, use the higher-level AsyncInputStream interface instead.

  //   rule does not hold, because it could simply be that the next record did not fit into the
