// Promises

template <typename T>
class Promise: protected _::PromiseBase {
  // The basic primitive of asynchronous computation in KJ.  Similar to "futures", but designed
  // specifically for event loop concurrency.  Similar to E promises and JavaScript Promises/A.
  //
  // A Promise represents a promise to produce a value of type T some time in the future.  Once
  // that value has been produced, the promise is "fulfilled".  Alternatively, a promise can be
  // "broken", with an Exception describing what went wrong.  You may implicitly convert a value of
  // type T to an already-fulfilled Promise<T>.  You may implicitly convert the constant
  // `kj::READY_NOW` to an already-fulfilled Promise<void>.  You may also implicitly convert a
  // `kj::Exception` to an already-broken promise of any type.
  //
  // Promises are linear types -- they are moveable but not copyable.  If a Promise is destroyed
  // or goes out of scope (without being moved elsewhere), any ongoing asynchronous operations
  // meant to fulfill the promise will be canceled if possible.  All methods of `Promise` (unless
  // otherwise noted) actually consume the promise in the sense of move semantics.  (Arguably they
  // should be rvalue-qualified, but at the time this interface was created compilers didn't widely
  // support that yet and anyway it would be pretty ugly typing kj::mv(promise).whatever().)  If
  // you want to use one Promise in two different places, you must fork it with `fork()`.
  //
  // To use the result of a Promise, you must call `then()` and supply a callback function to
  // call with the result.  `then()` returns another promise, for the result of the callback.
  // Any time that this would result in Promise<Promise<T>>, the promises are collapsed into a
  // simple Promise<T> that first waits for the outer promise, then the inner.  Example:
  //
  //     // Open a remote file, read the content, and then count the
  //     // number of lines of text.
  //     // Note that none of the calls here block.  `file`, `content`
  //     // and `lineCount` are all initialized immediately before any
  //     // asynchronous operations occur.  The lambda callbacks are
  //     // called later.
  //     Promise<Own<File>> file = openFtp("ftp://host/foo/bar");
  //     Promise<String> content = file.then(
  //         [](Own<File> file) -> Promise<String> {
  //           return file.readAll();
  //         });
  //     Promise<int> lineCount = content.then(
  //         [](String text) -> int {
  //           uint count = 0;
  //           for (char c: text) count += (c == '\n');
  //           return count;
  //         });
  //
  // For `then()` to work, the current thread must have an active `EventLoop`.  Each callback
  // is scheduled to execute in that loop.  Since `then()` schedules callbacks only on the current
  // thread's event loop, you do not need to worry about two callbacks running at the same time.
  // You will need to set up at least one `EventLoop` at the top level of your program before you
  // can use promises.
  //
  // To adapt a non-Promise-based asynchronous API to promises, use `newAdaptedPromise()`.
  //
  // Systems using promises should consider supporting the concept of "pipelining".  Pipelining
  // means allowing a caller to start issuing method calls against a promised object before the
  // promise has actually been fulfilled.  This is particularly useful if the promise is for a
  // remote object living across a network, as this can avoid round trips when chaining a series
  // of calls.  It is suggested that any class T which supports pipelining implement a subclass of
  // Promise<T> which adds "eventual send" methods -- methods which, when called, say "please
  // invoke the corresponding method on the promised value once it is available".  These methods
  // should in turn return promises for the eventual results of said invocations.  Cap'n Proto,
  // for example, implements the type `RemotePromise` which supports pipelining RPC requests -- see
  // `capnp/capability.h`.
  //
  // KJ Promises are based on E promises:
  //   http://wiki.erights.org/wiki/Walnut/Distributed_Computing#Promises
  //
  // KJ Promises are also inspired in part by the evolving standards for JavaScript/ECMAScript

  // Register a continuation function to be executed when the promise completes.  The continuation
  // (`func`) takes the promised value (an rvalue of type `T`) as its parameter.  The continuation
  // may return a new value; `then()` itself returns a promise for the continuation's eventual
  // result.  If the continuation itself returns a `Promise<U>`, then `then()` shall also return
  // a `Promise<U>` which first waits for the original promise, then executes the continuation,
  // then waits for the inner promise (i.e. it automatically "unwraps" the promise).
  //
  // In all cases, `then()` returns immediately.  The continuation is executed later.  The
  // continuation is always executed on the same EventLoop (and, therefore, the same thread) which
  // called `then()`, therefore no synchronization is necessary on state shared by the continuation
  // and the surrounding scope.  If no EventLoop is running on the current thread, `then()` throws
  // an exception.
  //
  // You may also specify an error handler continuation as the second parameter.  `errorHandler`
  // must be a functor taking a parameter of type `kj::Exception&&`.  It must return the same
  // type as `func` returns (except when `func` returns `Promise<U>`, in which case `errorHandler`
  // may return either `Promise<U>` or just `U`).  The default error handler simply propagates the
  // exception to the returned promise.
  //
  // Either `func` or `errorHandler` may, of course, throw an exception, in which case the promise
  // is broken.  When compiled with -fno-exceptions, the framework will still detect when a
  // recoverable exception was thrown inside of a continuation and will consider the promise
  // broken even though a (presumably garbage) result was returned.
  //
  // If the returned promise is destroyed before the callback runs, the callback will be canceled
  // (it will never run).
  //
  // Note that `then()` -- like all other Promise methods -- consumes the promise on which it is
  // called, in the sense of move semantics.  After returning, the original promise is no longer
  // valid, but `then()` returns a new promise.
  //
  // *Advanced implementation tips:*  Most users will never need to worry about the below, but
  // it is good to be aware of.
  //
  // As an optimization, if the callback function `func` does _not_ return another promise, then
  // execution of `func` itself may be delayed until its result is known to be needed.  The
  // expectation here is that `func` is just doing some transformation on the results, not
  // scheduling any other actions, therefore the system doesn't need to be proactive about
  // evaluating it.  This way, a chain of trivial then() transformations can be executed all at
  // once without repeatedly re-scheduling through the event loop.  Use the `eagerlyEvaluate()`
  // method to suppress this behavior.
  //
  // On the other hand, if `func` _does_ return another promise, then the system evaluates `func`
  // as soon as possible, because the promise it returns might be for a newly-scheduled
  // long-running asynchronous task.
  //
  // As another optimization, when a callback function registered with `then()` is actually
  // scheduled, it is scheduled to occur immediately, preempting other work in the event queue.
  // This allows a long chain of `then`s to execute all at once, improving cache locality by
  // clustering operations on the same data.  However, this implies that starvation can occur
  // if a chain of `then()`s takes a very long time to execute without ever stopping to wait for
  // actual I/O.  To solve this, use `kj::evalLater()` to yield control; this way, all other events
  // in the queue will get a chance to run before your callback is executed.

  template <typename ErrorFunc>
  Promise<T> catch_(ErrorFunc&& errorHandler) KJ_WARN_UNUSED_RESULT;
  // Equivalent to `.then(identityFunc, errorHandler)`, where `identifyFunc` is a function that
  // just returns its input.

  T wait(WaitScope& waitScope);
  // Run the event loop until the promise is fulfilled, then return its result.  If the promise
  // is rejected, throw an exception.
  //
  // wait() is primarily useful at the top level of a program -- typically, within the function
  // that allocated the EventLoop.  For example, a program that performs one or two RPCs and then
  // exits would likely use wait() in its main() function to wait on each RPC.  On the other hand,
  // server-side code generally cannot use wait(), because it has to be able to accept multiple
  // requests at once.
  //
  // If the promise is rejected, `wait()` throws an exception.  If the program was compiled without
  // exceptions (-fno-exceptions), this will usually abort.  In this case you really should first
  // use `then()` to set an appropriate handler for the exception case, so that the promise you
  // actually wait on never throws.
  //
  // `waitScope` is an object proving that the caller is in a scope where wait() is allowed.  By
  // convention, any function which might call wait(), or which might call another function which
  // might call wait(), must take `WaitScope&` as one of its parameters.  This is needed for two
  // reasons:
  // * `wait()` is not allowed during an event callback, because event callbacks are themselves
  //   called during some other `wait()`, and such recursive `wait()`s would only be able to
  //   complete in LIFO order, which might mean that the outer `wait()` ends up waiting longer
  //   than it is supposed to.  To prevent this, a `WaitScope` cannot be constructed or used during
  //   an event callback.
  // * Since `wait()` runs the event loop, unrelated event callbacks may execute before `wait()`
  //   returns.  This means that anyone calling `wait()` must be reentrant -- state may change
  //   around them in arbitrary ways.  Therefore, callers really need to know if a function they
  //   are calling might wait(), and the `WaitScope&` parameter makes this clear.
  //
