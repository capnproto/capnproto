  # getSubstream() returns a new stream object that can be used to write to the same destination
  # as this stream. The substream will operate until it has received `limit` bytes, or its `end()`
  # method has been called, whichever occurs first. At that time, it invokes one of the methods of
  # `callback` based on the termination condition.

  # While a substream is active, it is an error to call write() on the original stream. Doing so
  # may throw an exception or may arbitrarily interleave bytes with the substream's writes.

    # are forwarded to `next`.

    # If the `write()` call which reached the limit included bytes past the limit, then the first
    # `write()` call to `next` will be for those leftover bytes.
