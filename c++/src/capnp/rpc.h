  // received responses, the RpcSystem will not read further messages from the stream. This can be
  // used as a crude way to prevent a resource exhaustion attack (or bug) in which a peer makes an
  // excessive number of simultaneous calls that consume the receiver's RAM.
  //
  // There are some caveats. When over the flow limit, all messages are blocked, including returns.
  // If the outstanding calls are themselves waiting on calls going in the opposite direction, the
  // flow limit may prevent those calls from completing, leading to deadlock. However, a
  // sufficiently high limit should make this unlikely.
  //
  // Note that a call's parameter size counts against the flow limit until the call returns, even
  // if the recipient calls releaseParams() to free the parameter memory early. This is because
  // releaseParams() may simply indicate that the parameters have been forwarded to another
  // machine, but are still in-memory there. For illustration, say that Alice made a call to Bob
  // who forwarded the call to Carol. Bob has imposed a flow limit on Alice. Alice's calls are
  // being forwarded to Carol, so Bob never keeps the parameters in-memory for more than a brief
  // period. However, the flow limit counts all calls that haven't returned, even if Bob has
  // already freed the memory they consumed. You might argue that the right solution here is
  // instead for Carol to impose her own flow limit on Bob. This has a serious problem, though:
  // Bob might be forwarding requests to Carol on behalf of many different parties, not just Alice.
  // If Alice can pump enough data to hit the Bob -> Carol flow limit, then those other parties
  // will be disrupted. Thus, we can only really impose the limit on the Alice -> Bob link, which
  // only affects Alice. We need that one flow limit to limit Alice's impact on the whole system,
  // so it has to count all in-flight calls.
  //
  // In Sandstorm, flow limits are imposed by the supervisor on calls coming out of a grain, in
  // order to prevent a grain from inundating the system with in-flight calls. In practice, the
  // main time this happens is when a grain is pushing a large file download and doesn't implement
