    // Schema declarations can be compiled upfront, or they can be compiled lazily as they are
    // needed.  Usually, the difference is not observable, but it is not a perfect abstraction.
    // The difference has the following effects:
    // * `getLoader().getAllLoaded()` only returns the schema nodes which have been compiled so
    //   far.
    // * `getLoader().get()` (i.e. searching for a schema by ID) can only find schema nodes that
    //   have either been compiled already, or which are referenced by schema nodes which have been
    //   compiled already.  This means that if the ID you pass in came from another schema node
    //   compiled with the same compiler, there should be no observable difference, but if you
    //   have an ID from elsewhere which you _a priori_ expect is defined in a particular schema
    //   file, you will need to compile that file eagerly before you look up the node by ID.
    // * Errors are reported when they are encountered, so some errors will not be reported until
    //   the node is actually compiled.
    // * If an imported file is not needed, it will never even be read from disk.
    //
    // The last point is the main reason why you might want to prefer lazy compilation:  it allows
    // you to use a schema file with missing imports, so long as those missing imports are not
    // actually needed.

    //     EAGER_NODE | EAGER_CHILDREN | EAGER_DEPENDENCIES | EAGER_DEPENDENCY_PARENTS
