# Recall that Cap'n Proto RPC allows messages to contain references to remote objects that
# implement interfaces.  These references are called "capabilities", because they both designate
# the remote object to use and confer permission to use it.
#
# Recall also that Cap'n Proto RPC has the feature that when a method call itself returns a
# capability, the caller can begin calling methods on that capability _before the first call has
# returned_.  The caller essentially sends a message saying "Hey server, as soon as you finish
# that previous call, do this with the result!".  Cap'n Proto's RPC protocol makes this possible.
#
# The protocol is significantly more complicated than most RPC protocols.  However, this is
# implementation complexity that underlies an easy-to-grasp higher-level model of object oriented
# programming.  That is, just like TCP is a surprisingly complicated protocol that implements a
# conceptually-simple byte stream abstraction, Cap'n Proto is a surprisingly complicated protocol
# that implements a conceptually-simple object abstraction.
#
# Cap'n Proto RPC is based heavily on CapTP, the object-capability protocol used by the E
# programming language:
#     http://www.erights.org/elib/distrib/captp/index.html
#
# Cap'n Proto RPC takes place between "vats".  A vat hosts some set of objects and talks to other
# vats through direct bilateral connections.  Typically, there is a 1:1 correspondence between vats
# and processes (in the unix sense of the word), although this is not strictly always true (one
# process could run multiple vats, or a distributed virtual vat might live across many processes).
#
# Cap'n Proto does not distinguish between "clients" and "servers" -- this is up to the application.
# Either end of any connection can potentially hold capabilities pointing to the other end, and
# can call methods on those capabilities.  In the doc comments below, we use the words "sender"
# and "receiver".  These refer to the sender and receiver of an instance of the struct or field
# being documented.  Sometimes we refer to a "third-party" which is neither the sender nor the
# receiver.  Documentation is generally written from the point of view of the sender.
#
# It is generally up to the vat network implementation to securely verify that connections are made
# to the intended vat as well as to encrypt transmitted data for privacy and integrity.  See the
# `VatNetwork` example interface near the end of this file.
#
# Once a connection is formed, nothing interesting can happen until one side sends a Restore
# message to convert a persistent capability reference into a live one.
#
# Unless otherwise specified, messages must be delivered to the receiving application in the same
# order in which they were initiated by the sending application.  The goal is to support "E-Order",
# which states that two calls made on the same reference must be delivered in the order which they
# were made:
#     http://erights.org/elib/concurrency/partial-order.html
#
# Since the full protocol is complicated, we define multiple levels of support which an
# implementation may target.  For many applications, level 1 support will be sufficient.
# Comments in this file indicate which level requires the corresponding feature to be
# implemented.
#
# * **Level 0:** The implementation does not support object references.  `Restore` is supported
#   only for looking up singleton objects which exist for the lifetime of the server, and only
#   these singleton objects can receive calls.  At this level, the implementation does not support
#   object-oriented protocols and is similar in complexity to JSON-RPC or Protobuf services.  This
#   level should be considered only a temporary stepping-stone toward level 1 as the lack of object
#   references drastically changes how protocols are designed.  Applications _should not_ attempt
#   to design their protocols around the limitations of level 0 implementations.
#
# * **Level 1:** The implementation supports simple bilateral interaction with object references
#   and promise pipelining, but interactions between three or more parties are supported only via
#   proxying of objects.  E.g. if Alice (in Vat A) wants to send Bob (in Vat B) a capability
#   pointing to Carol (in Vat C), Alice must create a proxy of Carol within Vat A and send Bob a
#   reference to that; Bob cannot form a direct connection to Carol.  Level 1 implementations do
#   not support checking if two capabilities received from different vats actually point to the
#   same object ("join"), although they should be able to do this check on capabilities received
#   from the same vat.  `Restore` is supported only for looking up singleton objects as in level 0.
#
# * **Level 2:** The implementation supports saving, restoring, and deleting persistent
#   capabilities -- i.e. capabilities that remain valid even after disconnect, and can be restored
#   on a future connection.
#
# * **Level 3:** The implementation supports three-way interactions.  That is, if Alice (in Vat A)
#   sends Bob (in Vat B) a capability pointing to Carol (in Vat C), then Vat B will automatically
#   form a direct connection to Vat C rather than have requests be proxied through Vat A.
#
# * **Level 4:** The entire protocol is implemented, including joins (checking if two capabilities
#   are equivalent).
#
# Note that an implementation must also support specific networks (transports), as described in
# the "Network-specific Parameters" section below.  An implementation might have different levels
# depending on the network used.
#
# New implementations of Cap'n Proto should start out targeting the simplistic two-party network
# type as defined in `rpc-twoparty.capnp`.  With this network type, level 3 is irrelevant and
# levels 2 and 4 are much easier than usual to implement.  When such an implementation is paired
# with a container proxy, the contained app effectively gets to make full use of the proxy's
# network at level 4.  And since Cap'n Proto IPC is extremely fast, it may never make sense to
# bother implementing any other vat network protocol -- just use the correct container type and get
# it for free.

# ========================================================================================
# The Four Tables
#
# Cap'n Proto RPC connections are stateful (although an application built on Cap'n Proto could
# export a stateless interface).  As in CapTP, for each open connection, a vat maintains four state
# tables: questions, answers, imports, and exports.  See the diagram at:
#     http://www.erights.org/elib/distrib/captp/4tables.html
#
# The question table corresponds to the other end's answer table, and the imports table corresponds
# to the other end's exports table.
#
# The entries in each table are identified by ID numbers (defined below as 32-bit integers).  These
# numbers are always specific to the connection; a newly-established connection starts with no
# valid IDs.  Since low-numbered IDs will pack better, it is suggested that IDs be assigned like
# Unix file descriptors -- prefer the lowest-number ID that is currently available.
#
# IDs in the questions/answers tables are chosen by the questioner and generally represent method
# calls that are in progress.
#
# IDs in the imports/exports tables are chosen by the exporter and generally represent objects on
# which methods may be called.  Exports may be "settled", meaning the exported object is an actual
# object living in the exporter's vat, or they may be "promises", meaning the exported object is
# the as-yet-unknown result of an ongoing operation and will eventually be resolved to some other
# object once that operation completes.  Calls made to a promise will be forwarded to the eventual
# target once it is known.  The eventual replacement object does *not* get the same ID as the
# promise, as it may turn out to be an object that is already exported (so already has an ID) or
# may even live in a completely different vat (and so won't get an ID on the same export table
# at all).
#
# IDs can be reused over time.  To make this safe, we carefully define the lifetime of IDs.  Since
# messages using the ID could be traveling in both directions simultaneously, we must define the
# end of life of each ID _in each direction_.  The ID is only safe to reuse once it has been
# released by both sides.
#
# When a Cap'n Proto connection is lost, everything on the four tables is lost.  All questions are
# canceled and throw exceptions.  All imports become broken (all future calls to them throw
# exceptions).  All exports and answers are implicitly released.  The only things not lost are
# persistent capabilities (`SturdyRef`s).  The application must plan for this and should respond by
# establishing a new connection and restoring from these persistent capabilities.

using QuestionId = UInt32;
# **(level 0)**
#
# Identifies a question in the sender's question table (which corresponds to the receiver's answer
# table).  The questioner (caller) chooses an ID when making a call.  The ID remains valid in
# caller -> callee messages until a Finish message is sent, and remains valid in callee -> caller
# messages until a Return message is sent.

using AnswerId = QuestionId;
# **(level 0)**
#
# Identifies an answer in the sender's answer table (which corresponds to the receiver's question
# table).
#
# AnswerId is physically equivalent to QuestionId, since the question and answer tables correspond,
# but we define a separate type for documentation purposes:  we always use the type representing
# the sender's point of view.

using ExportId = UInt32;
# **(level 1)**
#
# Identifies an exported capability or promise in the sender's export table (which corresponds
# to the receiver's import table).  The exporter chooses an ID before sending a capability over the
# wire.  If the capability is already in the table, the exporter should reuse the same ID.  If the
# ID is a promise (as opposed to a settled capability), this must be indicated at the time the ID
# is introduced (e.g. by using `senderPromise` instead of `senderHosted` in `CapDescriptor`); in
# this case, the importer shall expect a later `Resolve` message which replaces the promise.
#
# ExportId/ImportIds are subject to reference counting.  Whenever an `ExportId` is sent over the
# wire (from the exporter to the importer), the export's reference count is incremented (unless
# otherwise specified).  The reference count is later decremented by a `Release` message.  Since
# the `Release` message can specify an arbitrary number by which to reduce the reference count, the
# importer should usually batch reference decrements and only send a `Release` when it believes the
# reference count has hit zero.  Of course, it is possible that a new reference to the export is
# in-flight at the time that the `Release` message is sent, so it is necessary for the exporter to
# keep track of the reference count on its end as well to avoid race conditions.
#
# When a connection is lost, all exports are implicitly released.  It is not possible to restore
# a connection state after disconnect (although a transport layer could implement a concept of
# persistent connections if it is transparent to the RPC layer).

using ImportId = ExportId;
# **(level 1)**
#
# Identifies an imported capability or promise in the sender's import table (which corresponds to
# the receiver's export table).
#
# ImportId is physically equivalent to ExportId, since the export and import tables correspond,
# but we define a separate type for documentation purposes:  we always use the type representing
# the sender's point of view.
#
# An `ImportId` remains valid in importer -> exporter messages until the importer has sent
# `Release` messages which (it believes) have reduced the reference count to zero.

# ========================================================================================
# Messages

struct Message {
  # An RPC connection is a bi-directional stream of Messages.

  union {
    unimplemented @0 :Message;
    # The sender previously received this message from the peer but didn't understand it or doesn't
    # yet implement the functionality that was requested.  So, the sender is echoing the message
    # back.  In some cases, the receiver may be able to recover from this by pretending the sender
    # had taken some appropriate "null" action.
    #
    # For example, say `resolve` is received by a level 0 implementation (because a previous call
    # or return happened to contain a promise).  The level 0 implementation will echo it back as
    # `unimplemented`.  The original sender can then simply release the cap to which the promise
    # had resolved, thus avoiding a leak.
    #
    # For any message type that introduces a question, if the message comes back unimplemented,
    # the original sender may simply treat it as if the question failed with an exception.
    #
    # In cases where there is no sensible way to react to an `unimplemented` message (without
    # resource leaks or other serious problems), the connection may need to be aborted.  This is
    # a gray area; different implementations may take different approaches.

    abort @1 :Exception;
    # Sent when a connection is being aborted due to an unrecoverable error.  This could be e.g.
    # because the sender received an invalid or nonsensical message (`isCallersFault` is true) or
    # because the sender had an internal error (`isCallersFault` is false).  The sender will shut
    # down the outgoing half of the connection after `abort` and will completely close the
    # connection shortly thereafter (it's up to the sender how much of a time buffer they want to
    # offer for the client to receive the `abort` before the connection is reset).

  # A number, chosen by the caller, which identifies this call in future messages.  This number
  # must be different from all other calls originating from the same end of the connection (but
  # may overlap with question IDs originating from the opposite end).  A fine strategy is to use
  # sequential question IDs, but the recipient should not assume this.
  #

  interfaceId @2 :UInt64;
  # The type ID of the interface being called.  Each capability may implement multiple interfaces.

  methodId @3 :UInt16;
  # The ordinal number of the method to call within the requested interface.

  allowThirdPartyTailCall @8 :Bool = false;
  # Indicates whether or not the receiver is allowed to send a `Return` containing

  # the method.

    # Send the return message back to the caller (the usual).

    yourself @6 :Void;
    # **(level 1)**
    #
    # Don't actually return the results to the sender.  Instead, hold on to them and await
    # instructions from the sender regarding what to do with them.  In particular, the sender
    # may subsequently send a `Return` for some other call (which the receiver had previously made
    # to the sender) with `takeFromOtherAnswer` set.  The results from this call are then used
    # as the results of the other call.
    #
    # When `yourself` is used, the receiver must still send a `Return` for the call, but sets the
    # field `resultsSentElsewhere` in that `Return` rather than including the results.
    #
    # This feature can be used to implement tail calls in which a call from Vat A to Vat B ends up
    # returning the result of a call from Vat B back to Vat A.
    #
    # In particular, the most common use case for this feature is when Vat A makes a call to a
    # promise in Vat B, and then that promise ends up resolving to a capability back in Vat A.
    # Vat B must forward all the queued calls on that promise back to Vat A, but can set `yourself`
    # in the calls so that the results need not pass back through Vat B.
    #
    # For example:
    # - Alice, in Vat A, call foo() on Bob in Vat B.
    # - Alice makes a pipelined call bar() on the promise returned by foo().
    # - Later on, Bob resolves the promise from foo() to point at Carol, who lives in Vat A (next
    #   to Alice).
    # - Vat B dutifully forwards the bar() call to Carol.  Let us call this forwarded call bar'().
    #   Notice that bar() and bar'() are travelling in opposite directions on the same network
    #   link.
    # - The `Call` for bar'() has `sendResultsTo` set to `yourself`, with the value being the
    #   question ID originally assigned to the bar() call.
    # - Vat A receives bar'() and delivers it to Carol.
    # - When bar'() returns, Vat A immediately takes the results and returns them from bar().
    # - Meanwhile, Vat A sends a `Return` for bar'() to Vat B, with `resultsSentElsewhere` set in
    #   place of results.
    # - Vat A sends a `Finish` for that call to Vat B.
    # - Vat B receives the `Return` for bar'() and sends a `Return` for bar(), with
    #   `receivedFromYourself` set in place of the results.
    # - Vat B receives the `Finish` for bar() and sends a `Finish` to bar'().

    thirdParty @7 :RecipientId;
    # **(level 3)**
    #
    # The call's result should be returned to a different vat.  The receiver (the callee) expects
    # to receive an `Accept` message from the indicated vat, and should return the call's result
    # to it, rather than to the sender of the `Call`.
    #
    # This operates much like `yourself`, above, except that Carol is in a separate Vat C.  `Call`
    # messages are sent from Vat A -> Vat B and Vat B -> Vat C.  A `Return` message is sent from
    # Vat B -> Vat A that contains `acceptFromThirdParty` in place of results.  When Vat A sends
    # an `Accept` to Vat C, it receives back a `Return` containing the call's actual result.  Vat C
    # also sends a `Return` to Vat B with `resultsSentElsewhere`.

  #    released.
  # 3) If the call has not returned yet, the caller no longer cares about the result.  If nothing
  #    else cares about the result either (e.g. there are to other outstanding calls pipelined on
  #    the result of this one) then the callee may wish to immediately cancel the operation and
  #    send back a Return message with "canceled" set.  However, implementations are not required
  #    to support premature cancellation -- instead, the implementation may wait until the call
  #    actually completes and send a normal `Return` message.
  #
  # TODO(someday):  Should we separate (1) and (2)?  It would be possible and useful to notify the
  #   server that it doesn't need to keep around the response to service pipeline requests even
  #   though the caller still wants to receive it / hasn't yet finished processing it.  It could
  #   also be useful to notify the server that it need not marshal the results because the caller
  #   doesn't want them anyway, even if the caller is still sending pipelined calls, although this

# Level 1 message types ----------------------------------------------

struct Resolve {
  # **(level 1)**
  #
  # Message type sent to indicate that a previously-sent promise has now been resolved to some other
  # object (possibly another promise) -- or broken, or canceled.
  #
  # Keep in mind that it's possible for a `Resolve` to be sent to a level 0 implementation that
  # doesn't implement it.  For example, a method call or return might contain a capability in the
  # payload.  Normally this is fine even if the receiver is level 0, because they will implicitly
  # release all such capabilities on return / finish.  But if the cap happens to be a promise, then
  # a follow-up `Resolve` will be sent regardless of this release.  The level 0 receiver will reply
  # with an `unimplemented` message.  The sender (of the `Resolve`) can respond to this as if the
  # receiver had immediately released any capability to which the promise resolved.

  promiseId @0 :ExportId;
  # The ID of the promise to be resolved.
  #
  # Unlike all other instances of `ExportId` sent from the exporter, the `Resolve` message does
  # _not_ increase the reference count of `promiseId`.  In fact, it is expected that the receiver
  # will release the export soon after receiving `Resolve`, and the sender will not send this
  # `ExportId` again until it has been released and recycled.
  #
  # When an export ID sent over the wire (e.g. in a `CapDescriptor`) is indicated to be a promise,
  # this indicates that the sender will follow up at some point with a `Resolve` message.  If the
  # same `promiseId` is sent again before `Resolve`, still only one `Resolve` is sent.  If the
  # same ID is sent again later _after_ a `Resolve`, it can only be because the export's
  # reference count hit zero in the meantime and the ID was re-assigned to a new export, therefore
  # this later promise does _not_ correspond to the earlier `Resolve`.
  #
  # If a promise ID's reference count reaches zero before a `Resolve` is sent, the `Resolve`
  # message may or may not still be sent (the `Resolve` may have already been in-flight when
  # `Release` was sent, but if the `Release` is received before `Resolve` then there is no longer
  # any reason to send a `Resolve`).  Thus a `Resolve` may be received for a promise of which
  # the receiver has no knowledge, because it already released it earlier.  In this case, the
  # receiver should simply release the capability to which the promise resolved.

  union {
    cap @1 :CapDescriptor;
    # The object to which the promise resolved.
    #
    # The sender promises that from this point forth, until `promiseId` is released, it shall
    # simply forward all messages to the capability designated by `cap`.  This is true even if
    # `cap` itself happens to desigate another promise, and that other promise later resolves --
    # messages sent to `promiseId` shall still go to that other promise, not to its resolution.
    # This is important in the case that the receiver of the `Resolve` ends up sending a
    # `Disembargo` message towards `promiseId` in order to control message ordering -- that
    # `Disembargo` really needs to reflect back to exactly the object designated by `cap` even
    # if that object is itself a promise.

  # when the reference count reaches zero.
}

struct Disembargo {
  # **(level 1)**
  #
  # Message sent to indicate that an embargo on a recently-resolved promise may now be lifted.
  #
  # Embargos are used to enforce E-order in the presence of promise resolution.  That is, if an
  # application makes two calls foo() and bar() on the same capability reference, in that order,
  # the calls should be delivered in the order in which they were made.  But if foo() is called
  # on a promise, and that promise happens to resolve before bar() is called, then the two calls
  # may travel different paths over the network, and thus could arrive in the wrong order.  In
  # this case, the call to `bar()` must be embargoed, and a `Disembargo` message must be sent along
  # the same path as `foo()` to ensure that the `Disembargo` arrives after `foo()`.  Once the
  # `Disembargo` arrives, `bar()` can then be delivered.
  #
  # There are two particular cases where embargos are important.  Consider object Alice, in Vat A,
  # who holds a promise P, pointing towards Vat B, which eventually resolves to Carol.  The two
  # cases are:
  # - Carol lives in Vat A, i.e. next to Alice.  In this case, Vat A needs to send a `Disembargo`
  #   message that echos through Vat B and back, to ensure that all pipelined calls on the promise
  #   have been delivered.
  # - Carol lives in a different Vat C.  When the promise resolves, a three-party handoff occurs
  #   (see `Provide` and `Accept`, which constitute level 3 of the protocol).  In this case, we
  #   piggyback on the state that has already been set up to handle the handoff:  the `Accept`
  #   message (from Vat A to Vat C) is embargoed, as are all pipelined messages sent to it, while
  #   a `Disembargo` message is sent from Vat A through Vat B to Vat C.  See `Accept.embargo` for
  #   an example.
  #
  # Note that in the case where Carol actually lives in Vat B (i.e., the same vat that the promise
  # already pointed at), no embargo is needed, because the pipelined calls are delivered over the
  # same path as the later direct calls.
  #
  # An alternative strategy for enforcing E-order over promise resolution could be for Vat A to
  # implement the embargo internally.  When Vat A is notified of promise resolution, it could
  # send a dummy no-op call to promise P and wait for it to complete.  Until that call completes,
  # all calls to the capability are queued locally.  This strategy works, but is pessimistic:
  # in the three-party case, it requires an A -> B -> C -> B -> A round trip before calls can start
  # being delivered directly to from Vat A to Vat C.  The `Disembargo` message allows latency to be
  # reduced.  (In the two-party loopback case, the `Disembargo` message is just a more explicit way
  # of accomplishing the same thing as a no-op call, but isn't any faster.)

# Level 2 message types ----------------------------------------------

struct Save {
  # **(level 2)**

struct Restore {

  #
  # Message type sent to restore a persistent capability obtained during a previous connection, or

  #
  # Level 0/1 implementations need to implement a limited version of `Restore` only for the purpose
  # of bootstrapping a new connection (otherwise, there would be no objects to which to address
  # methods).  These levels may simply implement public singleton services that exist for the
  # lifetime of the host process and probably have non-secret names.  A level 0 receiver of
  # `Restore` should never actually send a `Return` message, but should simply expect `Call`
  # messages addressed to the `PromisedAnswer` corresponding to the `Restore`.  A level 0 sender
  # of `Restore` can ignore the corresponding `Return` and just keep addressing the

struct Delete {
  # **(level 2)**
  #
  # Message type sent to delete a previously-saved persistent capability.  In other words, this
  # means "this ref will no longer be used in the future", so that the host can potentially
  # garbage collect resources associated with it.  Note that if any ExportId still refers to a
  # capability restored from this ref, that export should still remain valid until released -- thus
  # `Delete` behaves like POSIX's `unlink()` when called on a file that is currently open.
  #
  # Different applications may define different policies regarding saved capability lifetimes that
  # may or may not rely on `Delete`.  For the purpose of implementation freedom, a receiver is
  # allowed to silently ignore a delete request for a reference it doesn't recognize.  This way,
  # a persistent capability could be given an expiration time, after which the capability is
  # automatically deleted, and any future `Delete` message is ignored.
  #
  # A client must send no more than one `Delete` message for any given `Save`, so that a host
  # can potentially implement reference counting.  However, hosts should be wary of reference
  # counting across multiple clients, as a malicious client could of course send multiple
  # `Delete`s.

# Level 3 message types ----------------------------------------------

struct Provide {
  # **(level 3)**
  #
  # Message type sent to indicate that the sender wishes to make a particular capability implemented

  # party to proxy through the sender).
  #
  # (In CapTP, `Provide` and `Accept` are methods of the global `NonceLocator` object exported by
  # every vat.  In Cap'n Proto, we bake this into the core protocol.)

  questionId @0 :QuestionId;
  # Question ID to be held open until the recipient has received the capability.  A result will
  # be returned once the third party has successfully received the capability.  The sender must
  # at some point send a `Finish` message as with any other call, and such a message can be

  # What is to be provided to the third party.

  recipient @2 :RecipientId;
  # Identity of the third party which is expected to pick up the capability.

struct Accept {
  # **(level 3)**
  #
  # Message type sent to pick up a capability hosted by the receiving vat and provided by a third
  # party.  The third party previously designated the capability using `Provide`.
  #
  # This message is also used to pick up a redirected return -- see `Return.redirect`.

  questionId @0 :QuestionId;
  # A new question ID identifying this accept message, which will eventually receive a Return
  # message containing the provided capability (or the call result in the case of a redirected
  # return).

  provision @1 :ProvisionId;
  # Identifies the provided object to be picked up.

  embargo @2 :Bool;
  # If true, this accept shall be temporarily embargoed.  The resulting `Return` will not be sent,
  # and any pipelined calls will not be delivered, until the embargo is released.  The receiver
  # (the capability host) will expect the provider (the vat that sent the `Provide` message) to
  # eventually send a `Disembargo` message with the field `context.provide` set to the question ID
  # of the original `Provide` message.  At that point, the embargo is released and the queued
  # messages are delivered.
  #
  # For example:
  # - Alice, in Vat A, holds a promise P, which currently points toward Vat B.
  # - Alice calls foo() on P.  The `Call` message is sent to Vat B.
  # - The promise P in Vat B ends up resolving to Carol, in Vat C.
  # - Vat B sends a `Provide` message to Vat C, identifying Vat A as the recipient.
  # - Vat B sends a `Resolve` message to Vat A, indicating that the promise has resolved to a
  #   `ThirdPartyCapId` identifying Carol in Vat C.
  # - Vat A sends an `Accept` message to Vat C to pick up the capability.  Since Vat A knows that
  #   it has an outstanding call to the promise, it sets `embargo` to `true` in the `Accept`
  #   message.
  # - Vat A sends a `Disembargo` message to Vat B on promise P, with `context.accept` set.
  # - Alice makes a call bar() to promise P, which is now pointing towards Vat C.  Alice doesn't
  #   know anything about the mechanics of promise resolution happening under the hood, but she
  #   expects that bar() will be delivered after foo() because that is the order in which she
  #   initiated the calls.
  # - Vat A sends the bar() call to Vat C, as a pipelined call on the result of the `Accept` (which
  #   hasn't returned yet, due to the embargo).  Since calls to the newly-accepted capability
  #   are embargoed, Vat C does not deliver the call yet.
  # - At some point, Vat B forwards the foo() call from the beginning of this example on to Vat C.
  # - Vat B forwards the `Disembargo` from Vat A on to vat C.  It sets `context.provide` to the
  #   question ID of the `Provide` message it had sent previously.
  # - Vat C receives foo() before `ReleaseEmbargo`, thus allowing it to correctly deliver foo()
  #   before delivering bar().
  # - Vat C receives `ReleaseEmbargo` from Vat B.  It can now send a `Return` for the `Accept` from
  #   Vat A, as well as deliver bar().
}

# Level 4 message types ----------------------------------------------

struct Join {
  # **(level 4)**
  #
  # Message type sent to implement E.join(), which, given a number of capabilities which are
  # expected to be equivalent, finds the underlying object upon which they all agree and forms a
  # direct connection to it, skipping any proxies which may have been constructed by other vats
  # while transmitting the capability.  See:
  #     http://erights.org/elib/equality/index.html
  #
  # Note that this should only serve to bypass fully-transparent proxies -- proxies that were
  # created merely for convenience, without any intention of hiding the underlying object.
  #
  # For example, say Bob holds two capabilities hosted by Alice and Carol, but he expects that both
  # are simply proxies for a capability hosted elsewhere.  He then issues a join request, which
  # operates as follows:
  # - Bob issues Join requests on both Alice and Carol.  Each request contains a different piece
  #   of the JoinKey.
  # - Alice is proxying a capability hosted by Dana, so forwards the request to Dana's cap.
  # - Dana receives the first request and sees that the JoinKeyPart is one of two.  She notes that
  #   she doesn't have the other part yet, so she records the request and responds with a
  #   JoinResult.
  # - Alice relays the JoinAswer back to Bob.
  # - Carol is also proxying a capability from Dana, and so forwards her Join request to Dana as
  #   well.
  # - Dana receives Carol's request and notes that she now has both parts of a JoinKey.  She
  #   combines them in order to form information needed to form a secure connection to Bob.  She
  #   also responds with another JoinResult.
  # - Bob receives the responses from Alice and Carol.  He uses the returned JoinResults to
  #   determine how to connect to Dana and attempts to form the connection.  Since Bob and Dana now
  #   agree on a secret key which neither Alice nor Carol ever saw, this connection can be made
  #   securely even if Alice or Carol is conspiring against the other.  (If Alice and Carol are
  #   conspiring _together_, they can obviously reproduce the key, but this doesn't matter because
  #   the whole point of the join is to verify that Alice and Carol agree on what capability they
  #   are proxying.)
  #
  # If the two capabilities aren't actually proxies of the same object, then the join requests
  # will come back with conflicting `hostId`s and the join will fail before attempting to form any
  # connection.

  questionId @0 :QuestionId;
  # Question ID used to respond to this Join.  (Note that this ID only identifies one part of the
  # request for one hop; each part has a different ID and relayed copies of the request have
  # (probably) different IDs still.)
  #
  # The receiver will reply with a `Return` whose `results` is a JoinResult.  This `JoinResult`
  # is relayed from the joined object's host, possibly with transformation applied as needed
  # by the network.
  #
  # Like any return, the result must be released using a `Finish`.  However, this release
  # should not occur until the joiner has either successfully connected to the joined object.
  # Vats relaying a `Join` message similarly must not release the result they receive until the
  # return they relayed back towards the joiner has itself been released.  This allows the
  # joined object's host to detect when the Join operation is canceled before completing -- if
  # it receives a `Finish` for one of the join results before the joiner successfully
  # connects.  It can then free any resources it had allocated as part of the join.

  target @1 :MessageTarget;
  # The capability to join.

  # message, so that if multiple join parts are going to cross the same connection they can be sent
  # together, so that the receive can potentially optimize its handling of them.  In the case where
  # all parts are bundled together, should the recipient be expected to simply return a cap, so
  # that the caller can immediately start pipelining to it?

# ========================================================================================
# Network-specific Parameters
#
# Some parts of the Cap'n Proto RPC protocol are not specified here because different vat networks
# may wish to use different approaches to solving them.  For example, on the public internet, you
# may want to authenticate vats using public-key cryptography, but on a local intranet with trusted
# infrastructure, you may be happy to authenticate based on network address only, or some other
# lightweight mechanism.
#
# To accommodate this, we specify several "parameter" types.  Each type is defined here as an
# alias for `AnyPointer`, but a specific network will want to define a specific set of types to use.
# All vats in a vat network must agree on these parameters in order to be able to communicate.
# Inter-network communication can be accomplished through "gateways" that perform translation
# between the primitives used on each network; these gateways may need to be deeply stateful,
# depending on the translations they perform.
#
# For interaction over the global internet between parties with no other prior arrangement, a
# particular set of bindings for these types is defined elsewhere.  (TODO(someday): Specify where
# these common definitions live.)
#
# Another common network type is the two-party network, in which one of the parties typically
# interacts with the outside world entirely through the other party.  In such a connection between
# Alice and Bob, all objects that exist on Bob's other networks appear to Alice as if they were
# hosted by Bob himself, and similarly all objects on Alice's network (if she even has one) appear
# to Bob as if they were hosted by Alice.  This network type is interesting because from the point
# of view of a simple application that communicates with only one other party via the two-party
# protocol, there are no three-party interactions at all, and joins are unusually simple to
# implement, so implementing at level 4 is barely more complicated than implementing at level 1.
# Moreover, if you pair an app implementing the two-party network with a container that implements
# some other network, the app can then participate on the container's network just as if it
# implemented that network directly.  The types used by the two-party network are defined in
# `rpc-twoparty.capnp`.
#
# The things which we need to parameterize are:
# - How to store capabilities long-term without holding a connection open (mostly level 2).
# - How to authenticate vats in three-party introductions (level 3).
# - How to implement `Join` (level 4).
#
# Persistent references
# ---------------------
#
# **(mostly level 2)**
#
# We want to allow some capabilities to be stored long-term, even if a connection is lost and later
# recreated.  ExportId is a short-term identifier that is specific to a connection, so it doesn't
# help here.  We need a way to specify long-term identifiers, as well as a strategy for
# reconnecting to a referenced capability later.
#
# Three-party interactions
# ------------------------
#
# **(level 3)**
#
# In cases where more than two vats are interacting, we have situations where VatA holds a
# capability hosted by VatB and wants to send that capability to VatC.  This can be accomplished
# by VatA proxying requests on the new capability, but doing so has two big problems:
# - It's inefficient, requiring an extra network hop.
# - If VatC receives another capability to the same object from VatD, it is difficult for VatC to
#   detect that the two capabilities are really the same and to implement the E "join" operation,
#   which is necessary for certain four-or-more-party interactions, such as the escrow pattern.
#   See:  http://www.erights.org/elib/equality/grant-matcher/index.html
#
# Instead, we want a way for VatC to form a direct, authenticated connection to VatB.
#
# Join
# ----
#
# **(level 4)**
#
# The `Join` message type and corresponding operation arranges for a direct connection to be formed
# between the joiner and the host of the joined object, and this connection must be authenticated.
# Thus, the details are network-dependent.

using SturdyRefHostId = AnyPointer;
# **(level 2)**
#
# Identifies the host of a persistent capability which can be restored using a `Restore` message.
# That is, this identifies where the `Restore` message should be sent, but does not provide any
# part of the `Restore` message's content.  `SturdyRefHostId` is usually paired with a
# `SturdyRefObjectId`, often in the form of a `SturdyRef`.
#
# `SturdyRefHostId` could be as simple as a network address and public key fingerprint.  Or, it
# might be more complicated or abstract.  For example, on some kinds of networks, `SturdyRefHostId`
# might be an abstract service name without any information on where that service is physically
# located; the network itself might provide a separate service for mapping such names to locations.
# It could even be the case that a particular service name maps to a group of vats, where any vat
# in the group is able to restore the ref.  Such an approach would make `SturdyRefHostId`s more
# robust against changes in network topology.

using SturdyRefObjectId = AnyPointer;
# **(mostly level 2)**
#
# A SturdyRefObjectId identifies a persistent object which may be restored later, within the scope
# of some host.  The contents of a SturdyRefObjectId are entirely determined by the vat that hosts
# it.  In fact, different vats on the same network may actually use different definitions for
# SturdyRefObjectId, so SturdyRefObjectId is not actually parameterized per-network but rather
# per-vat.  A SturdyRefObjectId is typically paired with a `SturdyRefHostId` (in a
# `SturdyRef`) which describes how to find a vat capable of restoring the ref.

using ProvisionId = AnyPointer;
# **(level 3)**
#
# The information which must be sent in an `Accept` message to identify the object being accepted.
#
# In a network where each vat has a public/private key pair, this could simply be the public key
# fingerprint of the provider vat along with the question ID used in the `Provide` message sent from
# that provider.

using RecipientId = AnyPointer;
# **(level 3)**
#
# The information which must be sent in a `Provide` message to identify the recipient of the
# capability.
#
# In a network where each vat has a public/private key pair, this could simply be the public key
# fingerprint of the recipient.  (CapTP also calls for a nonce to identify the object.  In our
# case, the `Provide` message's `questionId` can serve as the nonce.)

using ThirdPartyCapId = AnyPointer;
# **(level 3)**
#
# The information needed to connect to a third party and accept a capability from it.
#
# In a network where each vat has a public/private key pair, this could be a combination of the
# third party's public key fingerprint, hints on how to connect to the third party (e.g. an IP
# address), and the question ID used in the corresponding `Provide` mesasge sent to that third party
# (used to identify which capability to pick up).

using JoinKeyPart = AnyPointer;
# **(level 4)**
#
# A piece of a secret key.  One piece is sent along each path that is expected to lead to the same
# place.  Once the pieces are combined, a direct connection may be formed between the sender and
# the receiver, bypassing any men-in-the-middle along the paths.  See the `Join` message type.
#
# The motivation for Joins is discussed under "Supporting Equality" in the "Unibus" protocol
# sketch: http://www.erights.org/elib/distrib/captp/unibus.html
#
# In a network where each vat has a public/private key pair and each vat forms no more than one
# connection to each other vat, Joins will rarely -- perhaps never -- be needed, as objects never
# need to be transparently proxied and references to the same object sent over the same connection
# have the same export ID.  Thus, a successful join requires only checking that the two objects
# come from the same connection and have the same ID, and then completes immediately.
#
# However, in networks where two vats may form more than one connection between each other, or
# where proxying of objects occurs, joins are necessary.
#
# Typically, each JoinKeyPart would include a fixed-length data value such that all value parts
# XOR'd together forms a shared secret which can be used to form an encrypted connection between
# the joiner and the joined object's host.  Each JoinKeyPart should also include an indication of
# how many parts to expect and a hash of the shared secret (used to match up parts).

using JoinResult = AnyPointer;
# **(level 4)**
#
# Information returned as the result to a `Join` message, needed by the joiner in order to form a
# direct connection to a joined object.  This might simply be the address of the joined object's
# host vat, since the `JoinKey` has already been communicated so the two vats already have a shared
# secret to use to authenticate each other.
#
# The `JoinResult` should also contain information that can be used to detect when the Join
# requests ended up reaching different objects, so that this situation can be detected easily.
# This could be a simple matter of including a sequence number -- if the joiner receives two
# `JoinResult`s with sequence number 0, then they must have come from different objects and the
# whole join is a failure.

# Network interface sketch
#
# The interfaces below are meant to be pseudo-code to illustrate how the details of a particular
# vat network might be abstracted away.  They are written like Cap'n Proto interfaces, but in
# practice you'd probably define these interfaces manually in the target programming language.  A
# Cap'n Proto RPC implementation should be able to use these interfaces without knowing the
# definitions of the various network-specific parameters defined above.

# interface VatNetwork {
#   # Represents a vat network, with the ability to connect to particular vats and receive
#   # connections from vats.

#   # Note that methods returning a `Connection` may return a pre-existing `Connection`, and the
#   # caller is expected to find and share state with existing users of the connection.

#   # that; the transport either queues these messages until authenticated, or sends them encrypted
#   # such that only the authentic vat would be able to decrypt them.  The latter approach avoids a
#   # round trip for authentication.
