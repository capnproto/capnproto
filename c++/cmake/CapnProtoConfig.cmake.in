# Cap'n Proto CMake Package Configuration
#
# When configured and installed, this file enables client projects to find Cap'n Proto using
# CMake's find_package() command. It adds imported targets in the CapnProto:: namespace, such as
# CapnProto::kj, CapnProto::capnp, etc. (one target for each file in pkgconfig/*.pc.in), defines
# the capnp_generate_cpp() function, and exposes some variables for compatibility with the original
# FindCapnProto.cmake module.
#
# Example usage:
#   find_package(CapnProto)
#   capnp_generate_cpp(CAPNP_SRCS CAPNP_HDRS schema.capnp)
#   add_executable(foo main.cpp ${CAPNP_SRCS})
#   target_link_libraries(foo PRIVATE CapnProto::capnp)
#   target_include_directories(foo PRIVATE ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR})
#
# If you are using RPC features, use 'CapnProto::capnp-rpc' in the target_link_libraries() call.
#
# Paths to `capnp` and `capnpc-c++` are exposed in the following variables:
#   CAPNP_EXECUTABLE
#       Path to the `capnp` tool (can be set to override).
#   CAPNPC_CXX_EXECUTABLE
#       Path to the `capnpc-c++` tool (can be set to override).
#
# For FindCapnProto.cmake compatibility, the following variables are also provided. Please prefer
# using the imported targets in new CMake code.
#   CAPNP_INCLUDE_DIRS
#       Include directories for the library's headers.
#   CANP_LIBRARIES
#       The Cap'n Proto library paths.
#   CAPNP_LIBRARIES_LITE
#       Paths to only the 'lite' libraries.
#   CAPNP_DEFINITIONS
#       Compiler definitions required for building with the library.
#   CAPNP_FOUND
#       Set if the libraries have been located (prefer using CapnProto_FOUND in new code).
